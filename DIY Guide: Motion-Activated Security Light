DIY Guide: Motion-Activated Security Light
Introduction
This guide helps you build a Motion-Activated Security Light using an Arduino Mega 2560, a PIR motion sensor, and an LED. Perfect for beginners, this project introduces basic electronics and programming concepts.

Components Needed
Arduino Mega 2560
PIR Motion Sensor
LED (any color)
Resistor (220Ω)
Breadboard (optional)
Jumper Wires

Step 1: Wiring Instructions
PIR Motion Sensor
VCC: Connect to the Arduino’s 5V pin.
GND: Connect to the Arduino’s GND pin.
OUT: Connect to Digital Pin 2.
LED with Resistor
Anode (long leg): Connect to Digital Pin 13 via a 220Ω resistor.
Cathode (short leg): Connect to GND.
Optional Breadboard Setup
Use a breadboard to organize the wiring:
5V pin: Connect to the positive rail.
GND pin: Connect to the negative rail.
Power the PIR sensor and LED from the rails.

Step 2: Upload the Code
Open the Arduino IDE.
Copy and paste this code:


const int ledPin = 13;
const int pirPin = 2;

void setup() {
    pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(pirPin, INPUT);
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    int motionDetected = digitalRead(pirPin);
    if (motionDetected == HIGH) {
        digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
        Serial.println("Motion detected!");
    } else {
        digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
        Serial.println("No motion detected.");
    }
    delay(100);
}

Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB.
Click Upload to transfer the code.

Step 3: Test the Circuit
Power the Arduino (via USB or external supply).
Allow the PIR sensor to stabilize (30–60 seconds).
Wave your hand in front of the PIR sensor:
The LED should turn on when motion is detected.
It should turn off when no motion is detected.

Tips for Success
Calibrate the PIR Sensor: Adjust the sensitivity and delay knobs for optimal performance.
Debugging: Use the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to verify sensor outputs.
Expandability: Add a buzzer or Wi-Fi module for advanced features.

Project Applications
Home security systems.
Automatic lighting in rooms or hallways.
DIY learning projects for students and hobbyists.
