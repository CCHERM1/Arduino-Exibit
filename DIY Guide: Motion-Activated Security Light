DIY Guide: Motion-Activated Security Light

Components:
Arduino Mega 2560
PIR Motion Sensor
Piezo Buzzer (New Component)
Breadboard (optional for organizing connections)
Jumper Wires
Wiring Connections:
PIR Motion Sensor:
VCC Pin: Connect to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
GND Pin: Connect to any GND pin on the Arduino.
OUT Pin: Connect to Digital Pin 5 on the Arduino.
Piezo Buzzer:
Positive Pin (long leg): Connect to Digital Pin 12 on the Arduino.
Negative Pin (short leg): Connect to the GND pin on the Arduino.
Breadboard Setup:
For better organization:

Connect the Arduino’s 5V pin to the positive rail on the breadboard.
Connect the Arduino’s GND pin to the negative rail on the breadboard.
Use these rails to power the PIR sensor and piezo buzzer.
Step-by-Step Instructions:
Place the PIR motion sensor and piezo buzzer near the Arduino on the breadboard (if used).
Connect the wires as described above, ensuring tight connections.
Ensure all components are oriented correctly:
PIR sensor pins are labeled as VCC, OUT, and GND.
Piezo buzzer pins are oriented as positive (long leg) and negative (short leg).
Power the Arduino via USB or an external power source.
Testing the Circuit:
Power on the Arduino and wait for the PIR sensor to stabilize (30–60 seconds).
Observe the behavior of the buzzer:
The piezo buzzer produces an audible sound when motion is detected.
The buzzer remains OFF when no motion is detected.
Notes on Code Changes:
The PIR motion sensor’s output pin is connected to Digital Pin 5.
The piezo buzzer is controlled via Digital Pin 12.
Ensure the code accounts for buzzer activation upon motion detection.
